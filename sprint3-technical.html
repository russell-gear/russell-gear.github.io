            <h3>Differences Between HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p>html is the cake. css is the icing.</p>
            <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
                <p>control flow refers to the order in which the computer processes a task. loops can be incorporated into that work flow order, but they are repetitive processes that 'loop' back into themselves.</p>
                <p>there are a number of different types of loops, some of which will terminate on meeting certain criteria.</p>
                <p>work flow is like running from wellington zoo to the gondola, with a loop in the middle at the basin reserve where your running coach requires you to do some laps. you can only continue on from the basin to the gondola when your coach says you've done enough</p>
            <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
                <p>the DOM! stands for the 'Document Object Model'. it is essentially a way of formatting code to be understandable (and therefore) enables interactivity between different languages. for example, this allows JavaScript to manipulate HTML/CSS elements.</p>
            <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h3>
                <p>arrays are good for things where the order is important. items are coded in order, and therefore you can access each item through it's position in the list.</p>
                <p>objects are similar to arrays but the items are unordered. therefore searching for items is done through a key (that maps to a value)</p>
            <h3>What are Functions?</h3>
                <p>functions are mini-programmes within the code. they are 'executed' when they are 'called' - this is called 'invoking the function'. functions are actually special types of objects that always return a value.</p>
                <p>this is where the superpower of the computer lies. being able to automate certain processes.</p>
