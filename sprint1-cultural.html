            <h3>Personal Values</h3>
                <p>curiosity, kindness and a little bit of pep.</p>
            <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
                <p>openness, fair-minded, stickler for details, sometimes opinionated, dogmatic - i'll let you decide which camps these fall into.</p>
            <h3>Cultural Influence</h3>
                <p>i grew up in south africa and new zealand, and to be honest for most of my upbringing i was exposed to a very mono-cultural environment - white, preppy and right wing. i'm proud that my friendship group is now definitely more diverse, much less preppy and almost exclusively left wing.</p>  
            <h3>An Ethical Decision</h3>
                <p>everyday provides ethical challenges around climate change and how we treat the planet. my wife jane sets a high bar - vegetarian, rides her bike everywhere, and is intentional about choices she makes. this is 'balanced' by my carnivoury, reliance on the car and generally being less thoughtful about the choices i make. thankfully jane's influence doesn't come to naught - i walk to work mostly, only eat vegetarian at home and am more inclined to question what i buy. in no ways perfect, but certainly better than i used to be. </p>        
            <h3>A Tricky Situation</h3>
                <p>medicine is the same same but different. it has the usual petty issues, but is also a uniquely pressured environment. it requires a hierarchy to function effectively, but danger lurks in that tree. working with colleagues can be tricky for all these reasons, particularly when they also display the same strengths and limitations as i've described. without getting into inappropriate detail, i had a run in with another doctor a few years ago - she wasn't willing to see a patient that i thought she should. she felt the same way about me, but wasn't particularly kind in the way she communicated that to me! i got pretty riled up and sent her a nerdy e-mail about what i thought should have happened. we also spoke about it at a later date, and got our departments to decide on what should happen in the future. the whole episode stuck with me for a long time thereafter, and was a good reminder about the importance of kindness. </p>
