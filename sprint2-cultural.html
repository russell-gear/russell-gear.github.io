            <p>my plan is to work as a geneticist in the long term, with an interest in education</p>
            <p>i'm really excited about this course but am not sure where it will lead, although being a full time programmer is unlikely</p>
            <p>a successful course for me is: committing to it, finishing it and getting to know the hihi team</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>ps unfortunately i'm away for the following dates - Friday 8th November and Monday 2nd to Thursday 5th December - apologies</p>
